    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 shallots, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>600g freshly ground beef (ask the butcher for something with roughly 15% fat - we used chuck)</li>
            <li>8 thyme sprigs, leaves picked and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>200ml crème fraîche</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>6 tarragon sprigs, leaves picked and finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

    <H3>How to cook</H3>
        
    <ol>
      <li>Rub the steak all over with a good lug of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>Add the steak to a hot pan, then cook for 6 minutes for medium-rare, or to your liking, turning every minute</li>
      <li>For more flavour, try one or a combination of the following… </li>
      <li>Halve a garlic clove and rub it over the steak every time you turn it</li>
      <li>Rub the steak with a knob of butter – the sweetness from the butter will make it taste divine!</li>
      <li>Or create a herb brush by tying woody herbs like thyme or rosemary to the handle of a wooden spoon and brush it over the steak every minute or so</li>
      <li>Once cooked to your liking, rest the steak on a plate that can collect all the lovely juices for 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Carve with a nice sharp carving knife, then serve with the resting juices drizzled on top</li>
    </ol>
